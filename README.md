## Project Description
I decided to create a little password generator based on some security strenght criterias, i choosed this project as i was curious about dictionnary attacks (brute-force attacks), that usually work the same way generating multiple combination until it finds the correct password. 

## Rules
The Password generator follows mainstream "strong" security criterias such as : 

1. Has to be of a length of at least 8 caracters
2. Has to have at least 1 upper case letter
3. Must include a numbers
4. Must include a symbol

## Workflow
Research on the project concept -> Coding -> Optimizing ->  Updating the forked repo -> Creating a new branch for our project -> Pushing the project and the others parts. 
## Organization
For this project I have followed the workflow template proposed on Trello. But not following the steps in the same order.
